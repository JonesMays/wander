## 🚀 **About the Project**

Wander is a smart wearable system designed to enhance the safety and independence of elderly individuals with dementia. Built during TreeHacks 2023, our solution addresses the growing challenges of dementia care by empowering caregivers and ensuring patient safety.

---

## 💡 **Inspiration**

With over 55 million people worldwide living with dementia, caregivers often face immense challenges in ensuring the safety and well-being of their loved ones. Inspired by Jones grandmother, we created Wander to provide a seamless, AI-driven solution that reduces caregiver stress and enhances patient safety.

## 🛠️ **How It Works**


- **Real-Time GPS Tracking**: The Wander Bracelet tracks the wearer’s location in real-time using an ESP32 microcontroller and GT-U7 GPS module 
- **AI-Powered Guidance**: Leveraging OpenAI and ElevenLabs, the system plays personalized audio prompts to gently guide users back to safety.  
- **Caregiver Notifications**: Integrated with Twilio, caregivers receive instant SMS alerts and activity reports.  
- **Seamless Connectivity**: Data flows between the hardware and software layers via MQTT and Firebase, ensuring real-time updates and analytics.
